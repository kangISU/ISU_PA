  % x > y: x is greater than y; F and G: speciﬁc French and Greek courses (one could also interpret these sentences as referring to any such course, in which case one could use a predicate Subject(c,f) meaning that the subject of course c is ﬁeld f;
  \item \textit{Buys(x,y,z)}: \textit{x} buys \textit{y} from \textit{z};
  \item \textit{Sells(x,y,z)}: \textit{x} sells \textit{y} to \textit{z};
  \item \textit{Shaves(x,y)}: person \textit{x} shaves person \textit{y};

\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Some students took French in spring 200l.
  \exists \textit{x Student(x)} \land \textit{Takes(x, French, Spring2001)}

  \item Every student who takes French passes it.
  \forall \textit{x, s Student(x) \land Takes(x, French, s) \to Passes(x, French, s)}

  \item Only one student took Greek in spring 2001.
  \exists \textit{Student(x) \land Takes(x, Greek, Spring2001) \land \forall y \ne x \to \lnot Takes(y, Greek, Spring2001)}

  \item The best score in Greek is always higher than the best score in French
